# system6markdowneditor
A Think C Mac Toolbox based markdown editor for System 6 and 7.

I recently restored two Compact macs: and SE/30 and an SE. I use a markdown editor on my modern mac for writing, but I wanted to use the old Mac as a writing machine. 

It's a WIP as I've never done any MacToolbox coding before. Whatever I make will be freely available.
